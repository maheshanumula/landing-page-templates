         <h1>SIP Calculator â€“ Systematic Investment Plan Calculator</h1>
      <p>Prospective investors can think that SIPs and mutual funds are the same. However, <br/> 
      SIPs are merely a method of investing in mutual funds, the other method being a lump sum. <br/> 
      A SIP calculator is a tool that helps you determine the returns you can avail when parking your funds<br/> 
       in such investment tools. Systematic Investment Plan or SIP is a process of investing a fixed sum of money <br/> 
        in mutual funds at regular intervals. SIPs usually allow you to invest weekly, quarterly, or monthly. </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A SIP calculator is a simple tool that allows individuals to get an 
          idea of the returns on their<br/>  <span className="text-teal-600 font-medium">mutual fund</span> investments 
          made through SIP.SIP investments in mutual funds have become <br/> 
          one of the most popular investment options for millennials lately.

        <p>
          These <span className="font-medium">mutual fund sip calculators</span> are designed to give potential
           investors an estimate<br/>  on their mutual fund investments. 
            However, the actual returns offered by a mutual fund scheme <br/> 
            vary depending on various factors. The SIP calculator does not provide  
            clarification for the exit load and <br/> expense ratio (if any).
